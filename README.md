This frame work can be compiled standalone, altough it depends on ROOT&&Boost libraries. Make sure you have "boost" downloaded when you try to compile this on your own machine. 

## To compile & run 

```sh
git clone -b Trilepton_Selection https://github.com/Jingyan95/Analysis.git TopLFV
cd TopLFV
make all
./RunAll

it takes 1~2 min to generate test.root file where you can find all the interesting distributions.  
```
